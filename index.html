				<p>We created our website because we understand</p>
				<p>that due to Covid-19, most gyms are closed and</p>
				<p>those who want to begin living a healthier lifestyle</p>
				<p>by exercises may not have those facilities at home.</p>
				<p>Some who are barely starting out might not know what</p>
				<p>exercises they should do along with the proper form.</p>
				<p>We hope this website can provide useful information</p>
				<p>to live a more active life for those who don't</p>
				<p>know where to begin.</p>
